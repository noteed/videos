The Nix recordings is a video series about the Nix ecosystem that I publish on
YouTube. In these pages, you can find a listing of the videos together with
their transcripts.

In this first video, not strictly speaking about Nix, I show one way to get a
fresh Debian-based virtual machine in the cloud. Such a machine is used in the
next video to show how to install Nix. [View on
