00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,800
In this video I show how to create a 
virtual machine in the cloud, then delete 

2
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,200
it. I'm using Digital Ocean and their 
command-line tool, called doctl.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,800
In the next video, I'll install Nix 
in such a virtual machine, hopefully 

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,440
replicating the experience of someone new to Nix.


5
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,840
If you plan to re-create what I 
do in this video, you'll need:

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,200
a Digital Ocean account,

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,720
a public/private SSH key pair (with the 
public key uploaded to Digital Ocean),

8
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,440
an API access token

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,520
and finally the `doctl` command-line tool itself.


10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,400
With those few things in place, 
let's look at the doctl command-line tool.

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,720
doctl accepts a `--help` flag to discover 
its capabilities, which are organized 

12
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,160
in subcommands. Each of them 
also accepts that `--help` flag,  

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,920
and also exposes
sub-subcommands.

14
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,760
And here is the command we use.

15
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,520
Digital Ocean calls their 
virtual machines "Droplets".

16
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,720
Droplets can be found in the "compute" subcommand.  


17
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,120
The very first argument will
be the name of our virtual machine.

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,120
Here we specify the region where we want 
our Droplet. Since I'm from Belgium, I 

19
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,320
use something close to me. 
In this case Amsterdam 3.

20
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:35,120
The virtual machine image we 
choose is based on a recent Debian.

21
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,840
We can specify the "size" of our Droplet, 
which means CPUs, memory, and disk.

22
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,880
We can also specify the fingerprint of 
our SSH keys. Note that the public key 

23
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,200
should already be uploaded to Digital 
Ocean through their web interface so they 

24
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
can copy it into the newly 
created virtual machine.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,920
When the command returns, doctl prints 
some information. In our case we limit 

26
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:06,000
it to some chosen fields. The 
one we are the most interested in  

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
is the IP
address.

28
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,760
Normally, the Digital Ocean API  

29
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:16,560
aknowledges the creation request and the doctl
call returns too. Here we use the `--wait`  

30
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
flag to wait until the virtual
machine is actually ready to be used.

31
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,200
This is useful for semi-automated scripts, 
so that we can SSH into the virtual 

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
machine right away, without polling 
to check for its availability.

33
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,400
Let's run that "create" command. 
Normally this takes about 40 seconds. But 

34
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,800
since we're in a video, we'll skip that part.


35
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,040
And now we can see, in the 
output of the doctl command,  

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,520
the IP address of our
brand new virtual machine.

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
So let's SSH as `root` into that machine.

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,600
Since it's the first time we encounter 
that machine we have to accept its SSH 

39
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
fingerprint... and that's it, we're in.


40
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,080
We can for instance check what kind of 
OS we have... and it's indeed a recent 

41
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,040
Debian-based system.

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's quit our SSH session. Normally I'd 
use a `ctrl-d` shortcut but we'll type 

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,840
`exit` in full for the video.


44
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,640
And now that we have used our virtual 
machine, we can delete it, also using the 

45
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,600
doctl tool. This ensures we no longer 
experience the costs associated to that 

46
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,480
virtual machine.

47
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,520
This is quite straigthforward: we pass 
the name of our Droplet and hit enter.

48
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,800
That's it for this video. In the next 
one, we'll see how we can install Nix.
